VAC: Predictive Analysis Assignment: Project 4

In this project, I have applied the following classification ML Models on scikit's breast_cancer dataset:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Gradient Boosting Classifier
4. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier

These models have been evaluated based on accuracy with following conditions:
1. With default hyper-parameters 
2. With tuned hyper-parameters

Finally, this project is submitted as a repository in github.
